# ProjectEuler-UpTo100
My solution for https://projecteuler.net/ 

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will 
require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive 
at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required 
to solve most problems."

As per the site rules, I can only post problems <= 100.
